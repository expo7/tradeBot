            <h2>What is Fundamental Analysis?</h2>
            <p>
                Fundamental analysis is the process of assessing a company’s financial health and performance to estimate its stock's intrinsic value. By understanding the underlying factors that drive a company's performance, investors can make educated decisions about buying, holding, or selling stocks.

            <h2>Key Components of Fundamental Analysis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Financial Statements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Income Statement:</strong> Provides insights into a company’s revenue, expenses, and profits over a specific period. Key metrics include Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Profit Margins.</li>
                        <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Shows a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. Important metrics include the Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Return on Assets (ROA).</li>
                        <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> Details cash inflows and outflows from operations, investing, and financing activities. Free Cash Flow is a critical metric here.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong> Measures the stock price relative to its earnings per share. A high P/E ratio might indicate growth expectations, while a low P/E might suggest undervaluation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:</strong> Compares the stock price to the book value per share. A high P/B ratio may indicate overvaluation, while a low P/B might suggest undervaluation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Profitability Metrics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong> Indicates the portion of a company’s profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.</li>
                        <li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> Measures how effectively a company uses shareholders' equity to generate profits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Growth Metrics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> Tracks the increase in a company’s sales over time. Strong revenue growth often signals a healthy, expanding business.</li>
                        <li><strong>Earnings Growth:</strong> Reflects the growth in a company's net income over a period. Consistent earnings growth can indicate a strong and sustainable business model.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Financial Stability</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Assesses a company’s financial leverage by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. A lower ratio suggests less risk, while a higher ratio indicates higher leverage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
